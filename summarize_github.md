This script interacts with the GitHub API to fetch issues and pull requests from a specified repository. It allows the user to filter the data by specifying a date range, repository owner, and repository name. The data can be stored in a local database, and users can optionally filter the fetched data based on criteria such as tags, comment authors, and title patterns. The script supports different logging levels and provides an option to only retrieve the data without filtering or printing. Key features include: - Fetching all issues and pull requests within a specified date range. - Updating existing records in the local database with new comments. - Filtering items based on dates, specific users, or ignored authors. - Printing the filtered items, including details such as title, URL, description, submitter, state, and comments. - Command-line options to configure the operation, including data retrieval only and filtering.
